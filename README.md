# Website Evidence Collector

The tool _Website Evidence Collector_ (WEC) automates the website evidence collection of storage and transfer of personal data. It is based on the browser Chromium/Chrome and its JavaScript software library for automation [puppeteer].

## ‚ö°‚ö° Quick Start

First, make sure Node.js (minimum version is `20`) and npm[^1] are installed. Check running `node -v` or install it by following the guide on the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
Linux users can also use their package manager (e.g., `apt install nodejs`). Check [Repology](https://repology.org/project/nodejs/badges) for your distribution.

Second, install the latest version of the Website Evidence Collector.
  ```bash
$ npm install --global https://code.europa.eu/EDPS/website-evidence-collector/-/releases/permalink/latest/downloads/website-evidence-collector.tgz
 ```

Third, run a collection.
```bash
$ website-evidence-collector https://example.com
```

Lastly, uninstall the tool using:
   ``` bash
   $ npm uninstall --global website-evidence-collector
   ```

[^1]: npm stands for Node.js package manager.

### Troubleshooting: Permissions

If you encounter permission denied errors during installation, try the following commands:

```bash
mkdir "${HOME}/.npm-packages"
npm config set prefix "${HOME}/.npm-packages"
```
---

## Run Website Evidence Collector

The WEC can be run in two ways. Either using the `collect` command on the command line, saving its output in a folder or using the `serve` command starting a webserver which can be accessed using the browser. The serve command is recommended for quick and simple scans.

**Notice on the Processing of Personal Data:** This tool carries out automated processing of data of websites for the purpose of identifying their processing of personal data. If you run the tool to visit web pages containing personal data, this tool will download, display, and store these personal data in the form of text files and screenshots, and you will therefore process personal data.

**Hint:**
If you run into command not found errors you have to add the `.npm-packages` to your `PATH`.  
Run the following commands:

```bash
NPM_PACKAGES="${HOME}/.npm-packages"  
export PATH="$PATH:$NPM_PACKAGES/bin"
```
You can check your `PATH` with this command: `echo $PATH`.

### serve
![Screencast Call](readme-assets/call-wec-serve.svg "Screencast showing serve command")

The `serve` command starts a local web server to display the collected evidence. By default, the website is available at http://localhost:8080/.

```shell
$ website-evidence-collector serve
```

You can customize the server port and browser options:

- Use `-p` to specify a different port.
- Use `--browser-options` to pass additional options to the internal Chromium browser. 

Example with custom port and browser options:

```shell
website-evidence-collector serve -p 8081 --browser-options='--disable-webgl' --browser-options='--disable-gpu'
```


### collect
![Screencast Call](readme-assets/call-wec-collect.svg "Screencast showing collect command")

The `collect` command is the default command for WEC when no other options are provided. It runs a collection from the terminal and saves the result in the output folder by default.

#### Basic Usage

```shell
$ website-evidence-collector https://example.com
```

#### Options

##### 1. Simple output on the terminal only:
   ```shell
   $ website-evidence-collector --no-output --yaml https://example.com 2> /dev/null
   ```
   This displays the output on the terminal and redirects logging to `/dev/null`.

##### 2. Ignore certificate errors during collection:
   ```shell
   $ website-evidence-collector -y -q https://untrusted-root.badssl.com -- --ignore-certificate-errors
   ```
   This ignores certificate errors when collecting data from the specified URL.

   All command line arguments after `--` (the second in case of `npm`) are applied to launch Chromium.

   Reference: <https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/#ignore-certificate-errors>

#### Integrate with testssl.sh:

   **Note:** [Testssl.sh](https://testssl.sh/) v3.0 or higher must be already installed. The most recent and with WEC tested version is [v3.0.6](https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh/releases/tag/v3.0.6).

   With the option `--testssl`, the website evidence collector calls `testssl.sh` to gather information about the HTTPS/SSL connection.

   a. Basic usage:
   ```shell
   $ website-evidence-collector --testssl https://example.com
   ```
   b. Specify testssl.sh executable location:
   ```shell
   $ website-evidence-collector -q --testssl-executable ../testssl.sh-3.0.6/testssl.sh https://example.com
   ```
   c. Use a pre-existing testssl.sh JSON output file:
   ```shell
   $ website-evidence-collector --testssl-file example-testssl.json https://example.com
   ```

## üêã Using Docker or Podman

A Docker/Podman container is available as a `Containerfile` for easy deployment:
- Build the Container (or use docker equivalent):
  ```bash
   $ docker build -t website-evidence-collector -f Containerfile
  ```
- To run the WEC server, forward the port:
  ```bash
   $ docker run -p 8080:8080 localhost/website-evidence-collector
  ```
- To collect evidence and save output, map a volume:
  ```bash
  $ docker run -v /path/on/your/system:/output:z --userns=keep-id localhost/website-evidence-collector collect https://example.com
  ```

- The container accepts the version of testssl.sh used through the environment variable `TESTSSL_VERSION`.

## Setup of the Development Environment

1. Install the dependencies according to the Installation Guide point 1.
2. Clone the Repository using Git
   ```bash
   $ git clone https://code.europa.eu/EDPS/website-evidence-collector.git`.
   ```
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the folder `website-evidence-collector`.
4. Install the dependencies and compile TypeScript
   ```bash
   $ npm install
   $ npm run install-frontend-dependencies
   $ npm build
   ```
5. Consider to use `npm link` to make the command `website-evidence-collector` available outside the project folder.

## TODO List

- [ ] some recorded HTTP cookies have not yet information on their origin (log data)
- [ ] fix bugs in HAR creation and verify accuracy, see <https://github.com/Everettss/puppeteer-har/issues> and [New HAR page doesn't appear to be created upon navigation chrome-har#19](https://github.com/sitespeedio/chrome-har/issues/19)
- [ ] optionally store web pages matching the keywords in markdown format, see <https://justmarkup.com/articles/2019-01-04-using-puppeteer-to-crawl-pages-and-save-them-as-markdown-files/>
- [ ] [puppeteer does not fully support PDF and downloads](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/2794), so that if `--max` is used to browse random links, the script skips links to content with different mime type than `text/html` and scans effectively less pages
- [ ] client-side redirects using e.g. `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1;URL='https://example.com'"/>` are followed, but not mentioned in the output
- [ ] in releases after v1.0.0, the option `--quiet` has no effect any longer ‚Äì instead debug output is printed to STDERR and can only be disregarded with `2> /dev/null`
- [ ] the library `puppeteer-har` is basically unmaintained and should be replaced by a fork. https://github.com/auteon/puppeteer-har/ provides a good starting point, but yields an install error as drop-in-replacement

- A tool to launch website-evidence-collector on several URLs or Sitemaps and generate a full report <https://github.com/ovh/website-evidence-collector-batch>
- A tool that incorporates many ideas of the WEC (but not the WEC itself) to analyse websites <https://github.com/the-markup/blacklight-collector>
- Dashboard to monitor several sites of your organisation for privacy requirements like third parties, cookies and just plain privacy violators <https://github.com/vincentcox/privacy-dashboard>
